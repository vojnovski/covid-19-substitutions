covid-19-substitutions
==================

Being optimistic in times of a widespread emergency is not easy. Maybe replacing all mentions with of a dangerous virus and disease with something more light-hearted will help us keep a healthier outlook towards our daily routines and life in general.

This extension replaces every mention of COVID-19 and Coronavirus in every page that you visit with something more benign and lighthearted.
